# TODO-List-Website

    • This project as it looks easy from the first glans it will be difficult to implement. Not approach or the mechanism because the steps of the program are clear as it can be, but in the complexity when adding many columns for the list they will be like a thread if at any turn something went wrong you will no solution, either to throw the thread or going backward to solve and that is where the complexity would occur.
    • The hardest part was the connection with the database and implementing one to many relationships, as the user will have a new table for each day task but how would the program specify if the user is updating an exciting table or want to create a new one. Considering the easy part was the design of the table and that was there are so many templates in the internet and you just need to get the combination of the bootstrap cards and divs to take that shape.
    • The biggest learn from today is that even if you identified a column in the database and even if you set it to nullable to update if in the creation of the new table you didn’t set a default value to and you tried to access it later the interpreter will give you an error indicating that the table do not have an attribute by that name.
    • For future improvement, it would be more attractive if the use of smtp module was included or twello to notify the user of the tasks they had set for the day.
